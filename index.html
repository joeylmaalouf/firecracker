		<div> <p> What is it?
			Rainmeter for Ubuntu, done in Python.

			Firecracker is a fanmade rewrite of Rainmeter for Ubuntu. Just like Rainmeter, Firecracker windows are fully customizable through editing of configuration files, giving users the ability to tweak and edit their windows to their liking.

			Why?
			This is our final project for SoftDes Spring 2015 at Olin.

			Dependencies
			PyGTK

			(comes with Ubuntu)

			Pyglet

			sudo pip2 install pyglet

			Pattern

			sudo pip2 install pattern

			How To Use It
			In order to run Firecracker manually:

			python2 firecracker.py <config file>

			In order to have Firecracker run on startup:

			clone this repo to some location .../firecracker
			$ cd .../firecracker
			put your configuration in skins/example.cfg
			$ sudo ./install.sh
			restart computer
			Notes
			If your system does not have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you should be able to use pip and python instead of pip2 and python2.
