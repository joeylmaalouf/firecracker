any text outside <> counts as a comment

< 
pos_x      = 0
pos_y      = 0
size_w     = 400
size_h     = 200
text       = testing
font_size  = 24
font_color = FF0000
alpha      = 050
font       = Ubuntu

also, the < and > have to be at the start
of their own lines to mark a proper item

< 
text       = 1+2=3
font_color = 00FF00
alpha      = 075
pos_x      = 500
pos_y      = 500
size_w     = 100
size_h     = 300
update     = 2000

you don't need to have every key property present;
they have default values if none are supplied

<
font_color = 0000FF
font_size  = 32
alpha      = 100
pos_x      = 750
pos_y      = 600
size_w     = 200
clock      = true

comments can be inside items, too!

fields can be in any order within items
