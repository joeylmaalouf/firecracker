any text outside <> counts as a comment

item ids go after the <
valid IDs are currently:
TEXT, CLOCK, WEATHER

< TEXT
pos_x      = 0
pos_y      = 0
size_w     = 400
size_h     = 200
text       = testing
font_size  = 24
font_color = FF0000
alpha      = 050
font       = Ubuntu
>

also, the < and > have to be at the start
of their own lines to mark a proper item

< TEXT
text       = 1+2=3
font_color = 00FF00
alpha      = 075
font_size  = 30
pos_x      = 500
pos_y      = 500
size_w     = 100
size_h     = 300
update     = 2000
font 	   = Times New Roman 
angle      = 45

you don't need to have every key property present;
they have default values if none are supplied

< CLOCK
font_color = FFFFFF
alpha      = 85
pos_x      = 600
pos_y      = 150
size_w     = 400
font_size  = 42
font 	   = Sawasdee
update     = 1000

comments can be inside items, too!
