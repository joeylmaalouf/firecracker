any text outside <> counts as a comment

< 
pos_x      = 0
pos_y      = 0
size_w     = 400
size_h     = 200
text       = testing
font_size  = 24
font_color = FF0000
alpha      = 050

also, the < and > have to be at the start
of their own lines to mark a proper item

you don't need to have every key property present;
they have default values if none are supplied

font_color = FFFFFF
font_size  = 32

font_size  = 42
clock      = true
font 	   = Sawasdee

comments can be inside items, too!
