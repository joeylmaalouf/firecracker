any text outside <> counts as a comment

item ids go after the <
valid IDs are currently:
TEXT, CLOCK, WEATHER, IMAGE

< TEXT
pos_x      = 0
pos_y      = 0
text       = testing
font_size  = 24
font_color = #FF0000
alpha      = 050
font       = Ubuntu
>

also, the < and > have to be at the start
of their own lines to mark a proper item

< TEXT
text         = Welcome to Firecracker!
font_color   = #FFFFFF
alpha        = 075
font_size    = 30
pos_x        = 100
pos_y        = 100
size_w       = 100
size_h       = 300
update_timer = 2000
font 	     = Arial 
angle        = 3

you don't need to have every key property present;
they have default values if none are supplied

< CLOCK
font_color   = #FFFFFF
alpha        = 85
pos_x        = 600
pos_y        = 150
font_size    = 42
font 	     = Sawasdee
update_timer = 1000

comments can be inside items, too!
